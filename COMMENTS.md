Robert Lewis code test

- Start my project with an npm install and then npm start 

- I included actual "Today's Dates" from the API but could only return one deal, so to show more results I used slice()

- in SellableShow.js i sorted the Book Now button href with a find() and includes() to get the URL instead of looking at the url_type because there was multiple links.

- I noticed some of the links lead to "Event Not Found"

- I quite enjoyed this task there's some education value in it for me so I went over the specific time on figuring the API and props data.
